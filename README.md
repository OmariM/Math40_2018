# Welcome to the Math40 2018 Homework File Repository!

## Description / Author's Note
This is a repository for LaTeX files for Math40 homework. This repo is designed to be a place where all TeXers alike can come together and crank out beautiful looking homework files so that we don't have to get points taken off for not copying over the problems properly. That being said, things don't always work as designed and I'm still a GitHub **noob** so if you have any questions or suggestions about how we can make this better by all means please hit me up and we can work something out!

More importantly--a lot of people put in a fair amount of time and effort into doing this for little recognition and no monetary compensation. That means they're doing this out of the charity of their own hearts. If you get the chance, **please please, PLEASE** extend your thanks to them. By doing this, they're really helping everyone out :)

## Read This If You Want To Contribute!
Thank you so so much for wanting to contribute! Let it be known that you don't have to be fluent in writing LaTeX to help out! We still need people to help review the files so that we can minimize the amount of effors in the file. With that, please be sure to read this. If anything is unclear or you have any questions, please don't hesitate to email me so we can get things sorted out quickly.

### General Workflow
So basically the idea is to create a platform where people can all work on making pretty math homework pdfs so that we can get them out to the people quickly. I'm still very new to GitHub so any help with optimizing this workflow would be extremely helpful. Things will sort of work like this:
1. Once a new assignment gets released. The first person to start TeXing the file will push it to master. From here on out, this will be the file that gets edited. And this goes for the rest of the workflow too but **as a rule of thumb**, we want to minimize the amount of (and ideally have no) duplication and maximize the readibility of the files
2. The first thing you'll want to do is check the issue's tab to see what progress has been made on the assignment. The Assignments will be labeled by homework section (i.e. HW 3 Section 3.2). Any issue that is open means that all of the **homework** problems haven't been completed. This means that if the practice problems haven't been completed, as long as the **homework** problems are done (as in, this section is ready for popular consumption), the issue will be closed or you can close it yourself. You are free to TeX up the practice problems, but those would go in a separate document and thus be a separate pdf.
3. Once you decide what problems you want to contribute, **POST A COMMENT IN THE SECTION OF THE PROBLEMS YOU ARE WORKING ON, INDICATING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO WORK ON THOSE PROBLEMS**. I cannot stress this enough how important it is that you do this. Reason being that we do not want duplicates problems and it would just be a hassle to have to clean and such.
4. Once the comment is posted, fork the repo from master and make **only the changes you said you'd make**.
5. Push it up to master and create a pull request. Be sure to be pretty specific about the title and comments of the request so that people know what you're talking about/what you've done. Be sure to indicate which section your pull request by linking the issue with it (i.e. if your section was logged as issue #31, then you would type #31 somewhere in your pull request comment). Also if your commit would finish all of the homework problems in the section, tag it with the label 'hw-problems-complete'.
6. For now, I'll manage merging the pull requests but if you want to help me out (pls send help) with reviewing pull requests and such hit me up.
7. Rinse and repeat I guess until the file is fully TeXed.

Quick note--if there are any disputes and such, just try to be nice pls :)

### Formatting
As far as formatting is concerned, check out HW02 for how things should look. That's currently the model we're using but if you think we should switch to something different feel free to let me know.
